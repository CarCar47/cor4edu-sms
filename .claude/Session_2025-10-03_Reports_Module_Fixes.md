## Issue #1: Enrollment Trends Report - 500 Error
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Enrollment Trends report returning 500 Internal Server Error due to non-existent Twig filter.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
Cloud Logging Error:
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Twig\Error\SyntaxError: Unknown "unique" filter
in "reports/admissions/trends.twig.html" at line 46
```

Template code attempted to calculate unique values in Twig:
```twig
<!-- Line 46 -->
{{ months|unique|length }}  ❌ |unique doesn't exist in Twig 3.x

<!-- Line 70 -->
{{ programs|unique|length }}  ❌ |unique doesn't exist in Twig 3.x
```

**Why This Happened:**
- Template tried to calculate aggregations in the view layer (anti-pattern)
- Twig 3.x doesn't include `|unique` filter by default
- Violates separation of concerns: calculations belong in backend

### Solution Implemented (Industry Standard)

Following **Gibbon framework patterns** and **industry best practices**:
> "Calculate aggregations in SQL, NOT in templates. Templates display data, they don't compute it."

**1. Modified `ReportsGateway.php` getEnrollmentTrends()** (lines 106-145)
```php
// BEFORE: Return only detail rows
return $stmt->fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

// AFTER: Return details + pre-calculated summary
return [
    'details' => $detailRows,
    'summary' => [
        'totalEnrollments' => COUNT(*),
        'uniqueMonths' => COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_FORMAT(...)),
        'uniquePrograms' => COUNT(DISTINCT programID)
    ]
];
```

**2. Updated PHP Controllers**
- `reports_admissions.php` (lines 96-100)
- `reports_overview.php` (lines 62-66)

Extracted summary statistics from gateway result:
```php
$trendsData = $reportsGateway->getEnrollmentTrends($startDate, $endDate);
$reportData = $trendsData['details'];
$summaryStats = $trendsData['summary'];  // Pass to template
```

**3. Fixed `trends.twig.html` Template**
```twig
<!-- BEFORE (lines 16-22) -->
{% set total = 0 %}
{% for row in reportData %}
    {% set total = total + row.enrollments %}
{% endfor %}
{{ total }}  ❌ Calculating in template

<!-- AFTER -->
{{ summaryStats.totalEnrollments|default(0) }}  ✓ Display pre-calculated value
{{ summaryStats.uniqueMonths|default(0) }}
{{ summaryStats.uniquePrograms|default(0) }}
```

### Results
✅ 500 error eliminated
✅ Follows industry standard (SQL aggregation)
✅ Matches Gibbon pattern (no template calculations)
✅ Faster performance (single DB query vs. template loops)

**Files Modified:**
- `modules/Reports/src/Domain/ReportsGateway.php`
- `modules/Reports/reports_admissions.php`
- `modules/Reports/reports_overview.php`
- `resources/templates/reports/admissions/trends.twig.html`

**Commit**: `1ec2155` - Fix Enrollment Trends Report
**Deployment**: Build `396628fa` - SUCCESS (3m21s)

## Issue #2: Career Services Reports - No Data + Export Errors
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Problems
1. **All 4 career reports showing**: "No data available"
2. **CSV Export failing**: "Export failed: Invalid report type: unverified_placements"
3. **Database table missing**: `cor4edu_career_placements` doesn't exist in Cloud SQL
4. **Schema drift**: Students table missing employment tracking columns

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem 1: Missing Database Tables**
```sql
Error: Table 'cor4edu_sms.cor4edu_career_placements' doesn't exist
```
Migration existed locally but was never applied to Cloud SQL (schema drift).

**Problem 2: Broken Export Handler**
`reports_career_export.php` only handled `verification_report` type:
```php
// BEFORE: Only one case
$reportData = $careerReportsGateway->getJobPlacementVerificationReport($filters);
// Missing: placement_rate, outcomes_summary, unverified_placements
```

**Problem 3: Export Process Mismatch**
`export_process.php` had generic handler:
```php
case 'career':  // Too generic, doesn't distinguish between sub-types
```

### Solution Implemented

**1. Created Comprehensive Database Migration** (`fix_career_reports_comprehensive.sql`)

**Safe Migration Features:**
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` for all table/column creation
- Conditional ALTER TABLE logic (MySQL-compatible)
- Data migration from students table → career_placements
- Creates 3 tables: career_placements, employment_tracking, job_applications

**Key Tables Created:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cor4edu_career_placements (
    placementID INT(10) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
    studentID INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    employmentStatus ENUM('employed_related', 'employed_unrelated', ...),
    employmentDate DATE,
    jobTitle VARCHAR(100),
    employerName VARCHAR(100),
    verificationDate DATE,
    verifiedBy INT(10) UNSIGNED,
    -- Plus 20+ compliance tracking fields
    -- Follows NACE reporting standards
);
```

**Migration Applied:**
```bash
# 1. Upload to Cloud Storage
gcloud storage cp fix_career_reports_comprehensive.sql gs://sms-edu-47_cloudbuild/

# 2. Import to Cloud SQL
gcloud sql import sql sms-edu-db \
  gs://sms-edu-47_cloudbuild/fix_career_reports_comprehensive.sql \
  --database=cor4edu_sms --project=sms-edu-47 --quiet
```
✅ SUCCESS - All tables created, data migrated

**2. Fixed Career Export Handler** (`reports_career_export.php`)

Added switch statement for all 4 report types (lines 67-91):
```php
switch ($reportType) {
    case 'placement_rate':
        $reportData = $careerReportsGateway->getPlacementSummaryByProgram($filters);
        $filename = 'placement_rate_by_program_' . date('Y-m-d');
        break;

    case 'verification_report':
        $reportData = $careerReportsGateway->getJobPlacementVerificationReport($filters);
        $filename = 'job_placement_verification_' . date('Y-m-d');
        break;

    case 'outcomes_summary':
        $reportData = $careerReportsGateway->getStudentCareerDetails($filters);
        $filename = 'employment_outcomes_summary_' . date('Y-m-d');
        break;

    case 'unverified_placements':
        $reportData = $careerReportsGateway->getUnverifiedPlacements($filters);
        $filename = 'unverified_placements_' . date('Y-m-d');
        break;
}
```

Dynamic CSV headers (no hardcoding):
```php
// Use first row keys as headers
$headers = array_keys($reportData[0]);
fputcsv($output, $headers);
```

**3. Updated Main Export Process** (`export_process.php`)

Added specific career report sub-types (lines 162-190):
```php
// Career report sub-types (matching academic reports pattern)
case 'career':
case 'placement_rate':
    $careerGateway = getGateway('Cor4Edu\Reports\Domain\CareerReportsGateway');
    $data = $careerGateway->getPlacementSummaryByProgram($filters);
    break;

case 'verification_report':
    $data = $careerGateway->getJobPlacementVerificationReport($filters);
    break;

case 'outcomes_summary':
    $data = $careerGateway->getStudentCareerDetails($filters);
    break;

case 'unverified_placements':
    $data = $careerGateway->getUnverifiedPlacements($filters);
    break;
```

### Results
✅ All 4 career reports now display data
✅ CSV export works for all report types
✅ Database tables exist with proper structure
✅ Follows NACE industry standards for career services reporting

**Files Modified:**
- `database_migrations/fix_career_reports_comprehensive.sql` (NEW)
- `modules/Reports/reports_career_export.php`
- `modules/Reports/export_process.php`

**Commit**: `b839a93` - Fix Career Services Reports
**Deployment**: Build `a72ed5e4` - SUCCESS (3m32s)
**Database**: Migration applied to Cloud SQL ✅

## Issue #3: Career Placement Report - Active Students Counted as Graduates
**Priority**: HIGH (Compliance Issue)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Active student "Student Tester" (STU001, status='Active') was incorrectly counted as a "graduate" in placement rate reports, violating **NACE First-Destination Standards**.

**User Report:**
```
"Job Placement Rate by Program shows 1 graduate, but the student is Active,
not graduated. Why is it auto making him a graduate?"
```

**NACE Standards Violation:**
- Career outcome/placement rates apply to **GRADUATES ONLY**
- Active students (still enrolled) cannot have placement rates
- Reports must track outcomes within 6 months of graduation

### Root Cause Analysis

**Default Filter Issue** (`reports_career.php:44-45`):
```php
// INCORRECT:
$studentStatus = ['Active', 'Graduated', 'Alumni'];  ❌ Includes Active students
```

**SQL Query Behavior** (`CareerReportsGateway.php:31`):
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT s.studentID) as totalGraduates  -- Counts ALL students in filter
```
Result: Active student counted as "graduate" → incorrect placement rate

**Migration Issue:**
Migration created placement records for ALL students, including active ones.

### Solution Implemented (NACE-Compliant + Flexible)

**User Requirement:**
> "Sometimes you need a report of students who are about to graduate, so you can prepare
> their resumes and get them ready for job placement. Understand?"

**Solution: Smart Defaults + Flexible Filtering**

**1. Changed Default Filter** (`reports_career.php:45-46`)
```php
// BEFORE:
$studentStatus = ['Active', 'Graduated', 'Alumni'];  ❌

// AFTER (NACE-compliant by default):
// Default student status (graduates only for NACE compliance)
// Users can manually select 'Active' for pre-graduation job readiness reports
if (empty($studentStatus)) {
    $studentStatus = ['Graduated', 'Alumni'];  ✅
}
```

**2. Dynamic UI with Context** (`placement_rate_table.twig.html`)

**When Graduated/Alumni only (default):**
- Column header: "Total Graduates"
- No warning banner
- Pure NACE-compliant placement report

**When Active students included (manual selection):**
- Column header: "**Total Students**" (not graduates)
- Yellow warning banner displays:

```twig
{% if 'Active' in selectedStudentStatuses %}
<div class="mb-4 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Active students are included in this report
    for pre-graduation job readiness planning. For NACE-compliant placement
    rate reporting, select only "Graduated" and "Alumni" statuses.</p>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

### Results

✅ **Default = NACE-Compliant**
- Reports show only Graduated/Alumni students
- Accurate placement rates for state audits

✅ **Flexible = Career Services Support**
- Staff can manually select "Active" for pre-graduation prep
- Clear warning shows this isn't a compliance report

✅ **User Experience**
- Users always know what type of report they're viewing
- No confusion between compliance vs. operational reports

**Use Cases Supported:**
1. ✅ State Audit/Compliance Reporting → Graduated/Alumni only
2. ✅ Pre-Graduation Job Readiness → Active students (manual)

**Files Modified:**
- `modules/Reports/reports_career.php`
- `resources/templates/reports/career/placement_rate_table.twig.html`

**Commit**: `5b1cc9a` - Fix Career Placement Reports: NACE-Compliant Defaults
**Deployment**: Build `a1e25c9b` - SUCCESS (3m39s)

## Issue #4: Overview Reports - 500 Errors (Enrollment Trends, Program Summary)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Problems
Two reports in Overview module returning 500 errors:
1. **Enrollment Trends**: `GET /reports_overview.php?reportType=trends` → 500 Error
2. **Program Summary**: `GET /reports_overview.php?reportType=programs` → 500 Error

### Root Cause Analysis

**Cloud Logging Errors:**
```
Twig\Error\LoaderError: Unable to find template
"reports/overview/trends_display.twig.html" at line 33

Twig\Error\LoaderError: Unable to find template
"reports/overview/programs_summary.twig.html" at line 37
```

**Architecture Problem:**
```
templates/reports/overview/
├── overview.twig.html (references missing templates)
├── summary_cards.twig.html ✓
├── trends_display.twig.html ❌ MISSING
└── programs_summary.twig.html ❌ MISSING

BUT... these reports already exist in:
templates/reports/admissions/
├── trends.twig.html ✓ EXISTS
└── enrollment_summary.twig.html ✓ EXISTS
```

**Duplication Issue:**
- "Enrollment Trends" existed in BOTH Overview and Admissions modules
- "Program Summary" existed in BOTH Overview and Admissions modules
- Poor information architecture: Where should users go for detailed reports?

**Missing Template:**
```
templates/reports/admissions/
└── demographics.twig.html ❌ MISSING (referenced in admissions.twig.html:37)
```

### Solution Implemented (Option B: Better Architecture)

**Dashboard Pattern** (Following Gibbon/Industry Standards):
> "Overview module = Dashboard ONLY (high-level KPIs)
> Detailed reports = Specialized modules (Admissions, Financial, Career, Academic)"

This follows Gibbon's approach: **Dashboards show summary metrics, not detailed data.**

**1. Simplified `reports_overview.php`**

**Removed duplicate report types:**
```php
// BEFORE: 4 report types (with duplicates)
$availableReportTypes = [
    ['value' => 'summary', 'label' => 'Institution Summary'],
    ['value' => 'trends', 'label' => 'Enrollment Trends'],  ❌ Duplicate
    ['value' => 'programs', 'label' => 'Program Summary'],  ❌ Duplicate
    ['value' => 'dashboard', 'label' => 'Dashboard Metrics']
];

// AFTER: 2 report types (dashboard only)
$availableReportTypes = [
    ['value' => 'summary', 'label' => 'Institution Summary'],
    ['value' => 'dashboard', 'label' => 'Dashboard Metrics']
];
```

**Simplified switch statement:**
```php
// BEFORE: Complex logic with duplicates
switch ($reportType) {
    case 'summary': ...
    case 'trends': ...      ❌ Remove
    case 'programs': ...    ❌ Remove
    case 'dashboard': ...
}

// AFTER: Clean, single responsibility
switch ($reportType) {
    case 'summary':
    case 'dashboard':
        $reportData = $reportsGateway->getInstitutionOverview();
        $reportTitle = $reportType === 'dashboard' ? 'Dashboard Metrics' : 'Institution Overview Summary';
        break;
}
```

**2. Updated `overview.twig.html`**

**Removed missing template includes:**
```twig
<!-- BEFORE -->
{% if reportType == 'trends' %}
    {% include "reports/overview/trends_display.twig.html" %}  ❌ Missing
{% elseif reportType == 'programs' %}
    {% include "reports/overview/programs_summary.twig.html" %}  ❌ Missing
{% endif %}

<!-- AFTER -->
<!-- Institution Summary / Dashboard -->
{% include "reports/overview/summary_cards.twig.html" %}  ✓ Always exists
```

**Added helpful navigation section:**
```twig
<!-- Detailed Reports - Quick Links -->
<div class="mt-6 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-4">
    <h3>Need Detailed Reports?</h3>
    <p>The Overview section shows high-level dashboard metrics.
       For detailed analysis, visit the specialized report modules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>→ Enrollment Trends Report (Admissions module)</li>
        <li>→ Program Enrollment Summary (Admissions module)</li>
        <li>→ Student List Report (Admissions module)</li>
        <li>→ Financial Reports</li>
        <li>→ Career Services Reports</li>
        <li>→ Academic Reports</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

**3. Created `demographics.twig.html`** (Admissions)

Full demographics report template with:
- **Table columns**: Name, Program, Status, DOB, Gender, City, State, Zip
- **Summary statistics cards**:
  - Total Students count
  - Gender distribution breakdown (Male/Female/Other/Unspecified counts)
  - Top locations by city/state
- **Empty state handling** with helpful message
- **Status badges** with color coding (Active=green, Graduated=blue, Alumni=purple)

### Results

✅ **All 500 errors fixed**
- Overview Trends → No longer exists (redirect to Admissions)
- Overview Programs → No longer exists (redirect to Admissions)
- Demographics → Now exists with full template

✅ **Better Architecture**
- Overview = Dashboard ONLY (follows Gibbon pattern)
- Detailed reports = Specialized modules
- Clear separation of concerns

✅ **Improved UX**
- Users understand: Overview = high-level, Sub-modules = detailed
- Helpful links guide users to the right reports
- No confusion about where to find specific data

✅ **Easier Maintenance**
- Single source of truth per report type
- No duplicate code/templates
- Follows industry standard information architecture

**Files Modified:**
- `modules/Reports/reports_overview.php`
- `resources/templates/reports/overview/overview.twig.html`
- `resources/templates/reports/admissions/demographics.twig.html` (NEW)

**Commit**: `d4cc836` - Fix Overview Reports: Remove duplicates, follow Gibbon dashboard pattern
**Deployment**: Build `634235b4` - SUCCESS (3m23s)

## Technical Patterns Applied

### 1. Industry Standards Followed

**NACE (National Association of Colleges & Employers):**
- Career outcome rates apply to GRADUATES only
- First-Destination Survey within 6 months of graduation
- Proper verification and compliance tracking fields

**Twig Best Practices:**
- No calculations in templates
- Pre-calculate all aggregations in backend
- Templates for display only, not computation

**Gibbon Framework Patterns:**
- Dashboard shows KPIs, not detailed data
- Specialized modules for detailed reports
- Single source of truth per report type

### 2. Database Migration Best Practices

**Safe Migration Techniques:**
```sql
-- MySQL-compatible conditional column addition
SET @preparedStatement = (SELECT IF(
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'table' AND COLUMN_NAME = 'column') > 0,
  'SELECT 1',  -- Column exists, do nothing
  'ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN column VARCHAR(100)'  -- Add column
));
PREPARE alterIfNotExists FROM @preparedStatement;
EXECUTE alterIfNotExists;
```

**Safe Table Creation:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_name (...);
```

**Data Migration Pattern:**
```sql
INSERT INTO new_table (...)
SELECT ... FROM old_table
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM new_table WHERE ...);  -- Prevent duplicates
```

### 3. Export Handler Pattern

**Flexible CSV Export:**
```php
// Dynamic headers (not hardcoded)
$headers = array_keys($reportData[0]);
fputcsv($output, $headers);

// Dynamic data rows
foreach ($reportData as $row) {
    $csvRow = [];
    foreach ($headers as $header) {
        $csvRow[] = $row[$header] ?? '';
    }
    fputcsv($output, $csvRow);
}
```

### 4. User Experience Patterns

**Contextual Warnings:**
- Show warnings when users deviate from compliance standards
- Explain why default settings exist
- Guide users to correct usage

**Smart Defaults:**
- Default = compliant with standards (NACE, state audits)
- Allow flexibility for operational needs
- Clear visual distinction between modes

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Twig Filter Limitations
**Lesson**: Twig 3.x doesn't include many filters that developers assume exist.
**Solution**: Always calculate aggregations in SQL/PHP, never in templates.
**Pattern**: `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` in SQL → pass to template → display directly

### 2. Schema Drift Management
**Lesson**: Local migrations don't automatically apply to Cloud SQL.
**Solution**: Systematic migration tracking and application process.
**Pattern**: Create migration → Upload to Cloud Storage → Import to Cloud SQL → Verify

### 3. NACE Compliance Requirements
**Lesson**: Career services reports have strict industry standards.
**Solution**: Default to compliant mode, allow flexibility with clear warnings.
**Pattern**: Smart defaults + contextual warnings + dynamic headers

### 4. Information Architecture
**Lesson**: Duplicate functionality across modules confuses users.
**Solution**: Follow Gibbon pattern - Dashboard for KPIs, modules for details.
**Pattern**: Overview = high-level only, specialized modules = detailed analysis

### 5. Export Handler Design
**Lesson**: Hardcoded CSV headers break when data structure changes.
**Solution**: Dynamic headers from data structure.
**Pattern**: `array_keys($data[0])` for headers, iterate over data dynamically
