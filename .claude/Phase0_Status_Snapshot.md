## 🔍 Error Details

### Primary Error
```
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException:
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146
Table 'cor4edu_sms.cor4edu_document_requirements' doesn't exist

Location: modules/Students/student_manage_view.php:82
Function: DocumentGateway::getRequirementsByTab()
```

### Root Cause
**Schema Drift** - 6 database tables exist locally but missing in Cloud SQL:

1. ❌ `cor4edu_document_requirements`
2. ❌ `cor4edu_student_document_requirements`
3. ❌ `cor4edu_faculty_notes`
4. ❌ `cor4edu_student_meetings`
5. ❌ `cor4edu_academic_support_sessions`
6. ❌ `cor4edu_academic_interventions`

### Migration Files Available
- ✅ `database_migrations/add_document_requirements.sql` (creates tables 1-2)
- ✅ `database_migrations/create_faculty_notes_system.sql` (creates tables 3-6)

## 📊 Manual Testing Results (Pre-Fix)

| Feature | Test Action | Result | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Login | Login as SuperAdmin | Success | ✅ |
| Staff List | View /modules/Staff/staff_manage.php | Success | ✅ |
| Staff Profile | View individual staff member | Success | ✅ |
| Student List | View /modules/Students/student_manage.php | Success | ✅ |
| Student Profile | Click student name to view profile | **HTTP 500** | ❌ |
| Programs | View program list with tabs | Success | ✅ |

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objectives
After applying missing table migrations, the following should work:
- ✅ Student profile viewing (no 500 error)
- ✅ All 7 student tabs accessible
- ✅ Document requirements loading
- ✅ Faculty notes accessible
- ✅ Student meetings accessible

---

# Stop service traffic (optional)
gcloud run services update sms-edu \
    --no-traffic \
    --project=sms-edu-47 \
    --region=us-central1

# Restore database
gcloud sql backups restore 1759440089736 \
    --backup-instance=sms-edu-db \
    --project=sms-edu-47

## 📝 Notes
- This is the THIRD occurrence of schema drift (Issues #8, #9, #11)
- Pattern: Code deploys automatically (Cloud Build), schema deploys manually (forgotten)
- Phase 5 will add automated schema validation to prevent future occurrences
- No automated tests exist despite testing frameworks installed (PHPUnit, Codeception)
- Production readiness currently at 37% (D grade)

**Next Phase**: Phase 1 - Fix Student Profiles (Apply Missing Table Migrations)
