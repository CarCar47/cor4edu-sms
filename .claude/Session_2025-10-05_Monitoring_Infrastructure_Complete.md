## Work Completed This Session

### Phase 6.4: Monitoring Dashboard ✅

**Objective**: Create simple monitoring dashboard with 6 essential metrics for solo developer

**Deliverables**:
1. **Dashboard Configuration**: `monitoring/dashboard.json`
   - Dashboard ID: `d216376b-f0fb-4e41-af32-edd1270a09de`
   - Name: "COR4EDU SMS - Infrastructure Health"
   - Layout: 12-column mosaic with 6 tiles

2. **Metrics Configured**:
   - **Request Count** (Last Hour) - Traffic volume monitoring
   - **Error Rate** (4xx + 5xx) - Application error tracking
   - **Request Latency (p95)** - Performance monitoring
   - **Container Memory Usage** - Resource utilization
   - **Container CPU Usage** - Compute utilization
   - **Active Container Instances** - Auto-scaling visibility

**Deployment**:
```bash
gcloud monitoring dashboards create \
  --config-from-file=monitoring/dashboard.json \
  --project=sms-edu-47
```

**Result**: Dashboard deployed successfully, accessible at:
https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards?project=sms-edu-47

**Duration**: 20 minutes (including research and deployment)

---

### Phase 6.5: Alert Policies ✅

**Objective**: Configure two critical alerts for immediate incident notification

**Deliverables**:
1. **Alert Policy Files**:
   - `monitoring/alert-health-check.json` - Immediate notification on health endpoint 503
   - `monitoring/alert-error-rate.json` - Alert when error rate >10% for 5 minutes

2. **Alert Configuration Guide**: `monitoring/ALERT_SETUP.md`
   - **Option 1**: Quick setup via Cloud Console (recommended for solo developer)
   - **Option 2**: Setup via gcloud CLI (requires alpha components)
   - Step-by-step instructions for both approaches
   - Testing procedures

**Alert Details**:

**Health Check Alert**:
- **Trigger**: HTTP 503 from /health.php endpoint
- **Duration**: Immediate (0 seconds)
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Documentation**: Troubleshooting steps for database, filesystem, and system checks

**Error Rate Alert**:
- **Trigger**: Error rate >10% (4xx + 5xx responses)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes sustained
- **Severity**: High
- **Documentation**: Steps to diagnose code issues, database problems, external dependencies

**CLI Limitation Discovered**: gcloud monitoring commands require alpha components not installed. Solution: Created comprehensive guide for Cloud Console setup (industry-standard approach for solo developers).

**Duration**: 15 minutes

## Key Learning: Proper Tool Usage

### Issue Encountered
While creating `FERPA_COMPLIANCE.md`, I initially attempted to use:
1. Bash `cat` with heredoc (failed due to quote escaping)
2. Python script as a workaround (rejected by user)

### User Feedback
> "is that industry standard? we dont have python in our system do we? does that matter? is this a workaround? i dont like those. how should this be done?"

### Correct Approach
**Industry Standard**: Use the **Write tool** directly for creating new files.
- Write tool doesn't require reading first for NEW files
- Only requires reading when OVERWRITING existing files
- Clean, simple, no workarounds needed

### Lesson Learned
- Always use the proper tool for the task
- Don't create workarounds when standard tools exist
- User was correct to challenge the approach
- Following industry standards means using the right tool
