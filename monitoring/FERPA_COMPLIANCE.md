---

## Executive Summary

The COR4EDU Student Management System (SMS) on Google Cloud Platform has been designed and deployed with FERPA compliance as a core requirement. This document outlines the technical safeguards, access controls, data encryption, and audit logging mechanisms that ensure the protection of student educational records.

## 1. Data Encryption

### 1.1 Data at Rest
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- **Database Encryption**: Cloud SQL instance uses Google-managed encryption keys
  - Automatic encryption of all database files
  - Encryption of automated backups
  - Encryption of temporary files used for query operations

- **Storage Buckets**: All Cloud Storage buckets use encryption by default
  - Application assets encrypted at rest
  - Document uploads encrypted at rest

**Verification**:
```bash
gcloud sql instances describe sms-edu-instance --project=sms-edu-47 | grep encryptionKind
# Output: GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION
```

### 1.2 Data in Transit
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic to Cloud Run service uses TLS 1.2+
  - Cloud Run managed certificate
  - Automatic HTTPS redirect
  - No unencrypted HTTP access allowed

- **Database Connections**: Cloud SQL connections use encrypted Unix sockets
  - Private IP connectivity via VPC
  - Encrypted connection from Cloud Run to Cloud SQL

**Configuration**: `cloudbuild.yaml:166-168`
```yaml
--set-env-vars
  DB_SOCKET=/cloudsql/${PROJECT_ID}:${_REGION}:${_CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE}
```

---

## 2. Access Controls

### 2.1 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Principle of Least Privilege Applied**:
- Service Account: `sms-edu-sa@sms-edu-47.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - Limited to Cloud SQL Client role
  - No broad admin permissions
  - Scoped to project resources only

**User Access**:
- Application-level access control via Staff Permissions module
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at application layer
- Database credentials stored in Secret Manager (never in code)

### 2.2 Database Access Control
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- **No Public IP Access**: Cloud SQL instance has no public IP address
- **Private Connectivity Only**: Access restricted to authorized Cloud Run services via Unix socket
- **Credential Management**:
  - Database username stored in Secret Manager: `db-username`
  - Database password stored in Secret Manager: `db-password`
  - Secrets rotatable without code changes

**Verification**:
```bash
gcloud sql instances describe sms-edu-instance --project=sms-edu-47 | grep ipAddress
# Output: Shows only private IP (10.x.x.x range)
```

### 2.3 Application Access Control
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- **Authentication Required**: All routes protected by authentication middleware
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with httpOnly cookies
- **Permission System**: Granular permissions per staff member
  - View vs. Edit vs. Delete permissions
  - Module-level access control
  - Student data access restrictions based on role

**Implementation**: `src/Infrastructure/AuthenticationMiddleware.php`

---

## 3. Audit Logging

### 3.1 Cloud Logging Integration
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**What is Logged**:
- All HTTP requests (timestamp, user, action, IP address)
- Database queries (via application logging)
- Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Data modification events (create, update, delete)
- Permission changes
- Error events

**Log Retention**: 30 days (configurable up to 3650 days)

**Access Logs**:
```bash
# View application logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=sms-edu" \
  --limit=50 --format=json --project=sms-edu-47

# View authentication events
gcloud logging read "jsonPayload.message=~\"Authentication\"" \
  --limit=50 --project=sms-edu-47
```

### 3.2 Database Audit Trail
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- **Application-Level Audit**: All student record modifications logged
  - Who made the change (staffID)
  - What was changed (before/after values)
  - When the change occurred (timestamp)

- **System-Level Audit**: Cloud SQL audit logging enabled
  - Connection attempts
  - Query execution
  - Schema changes

**Implementation**: Logging configured in `bootstrap.php` and individual gateways

---

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

### 4.1 Backup Retention
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- **Automated Backups**: Daily at 3:00 AM UTC
- **Retention Period**: 7 days
- **Backup Encryption**: Google-managed encryption keys
- **Backup Location**: us-central1 (same region as production)

### 4.2 Data Deletion Procedures
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Student Record Deletion**:
1. Soft delete with `deletedAt` timestamp (maintains audit trail)
2. Hard delete available to authorized administrators
3. Cascade deletion of related records (enrollments, grades, documents)
4. Deletion events logged in audit trail

**Right to be Forgotten**:
- Manual deletion process documented in application admin guide
- Backup deletion requires manual purge of old backups

---

## 5. Incident Response

### 5.1 Security Monitoring
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Real-time Monitoring**:
- Health check monitoring (every 60 seconds)
- Error rate monitoring (alert if >10% for 5 minutes)
- Infrastructure dashboard: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring?project=sms-edu-47

**Alert Configuration**: See `monitoring/ALERT_SETUP.md`

### 5.2 Incident Response Plan
**Status**: ✅ DOCUMENTED

**In case of security incident**:

1. **Detection** (automated via alerts)
   - Health check failures
   - Unusual error rates
   - Authentication failures

2. **Containment** (immediate actions)
   - Review Cloud Run logs for suspicious activity
   - Check database query logs for unauthorized access
   - Disable compromised user accounts if identified

3. **Investigation** (forensics)
   ```bash
   # Collect logs from incident timeframe
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision" \
     --format=json \
     --project=sms-edu-47 \
     > incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
   ```

4. **Recovery** (restore operations)
   - Roll back to previous deployment if needed
   - Restore database from backup if corrupted
   - See `monitoring/RUNBOOKS.md` for detailed procedures

5. **Notification** (required by FERPA)
   - Document all affected student records
   - Notify appropriate administrators
   - Comply with institutional breach notification policies
